# Playing Battleships with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Solving the classical board game [battleships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) using a deep reinforcement agent. The goal is to minimize the number of steps to complete the game.

## Results
The best agent manages to achieve a mean game length of around 61. Training took around 50 hours on an i7 4770K CPU, where the agent played a total of 3.3 million games. The plot was generated by playing 250 games every 1000 steps in the training of the model, then taking the average of the recorded game lengths. The plots also displays the 25% and 75% percentiles of the game lengths.

Below you can see an animation of the agent performing the task as well as the action probabilities. More animations can be found in the animations folder.

Other attempts include DQN which did not learn anything. I suspect that the reason for this is the highly stochastic nature of the game prohibits the agent to learn a good Q function.
